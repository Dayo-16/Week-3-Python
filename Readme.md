## Defining a Function

This project demonstrates a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## Features
- Defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)`:
  - If the discount percentage is **20% or higher**, the discount is applied.
  - Otherwise, the original price is returned.
- Prompts the user to:
  1. Enter the original price of an item.
  2. Enter the discount percentage.
- Prints either:
  - The discounted price (if discount â‰¥ 20%).
  - Or the original price (if discount < 20%).
